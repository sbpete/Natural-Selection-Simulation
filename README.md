# Natural-Selection-Simulation
OVERVIEW
Test natural selection against different preadtor/prey population sizes and genetic variation rates

Size is a unique factor given to each human object
  - Smaller humans are faster but more likely to fail a wolf attack (get eaten)
  - Larger humans are slowe but more likely to survive a wolf attack (deflect the wolf)
  
 Humans will wander randomly and reproduce at random range time intervals
 Offspring will be born with average size of both parents + some accentuation

INSTRUCTIONS
  - Set values using up and down arrows as well as ENTER key\
  - Let simulation run
  - Change simulation speed with up and down arrows
  - Press R to restart simulation
