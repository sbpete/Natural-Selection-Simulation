# Natural-Selection-Simulation
Test natural selection against different preadtor/prey population sizes and genetic variation rates

Size is a unique factor given to each human object
  - Smaller humans are faster but more likely to fail a wolf attack (get eaten)
  - Larger humans are slowe but more likely to survive a wolf attack (deflect the wolf)
  
 Humans will wander randomly and reproduce at random range time intervals
 Offspring will be born with average size of both parents + some accentuation
